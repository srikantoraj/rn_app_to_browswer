iOS Configuration
For iOS, you have two options: URL Schemes and Universal Links. URL Schemes are easier to set up but less secure and versatile than Universal Links. Iâ€™ll cover URL Schemes here.

Modify Info.plist for URL Schemes:
Open your iOS project in Xcode (ios/YourProjectName.xcodeproj or ios/YourProjectName.workspace if you're using Cocoapods).
Click on your project in the Project Navigator, then select your app's target.
Go to the Info tab, and look for URL Types.
Click the + button to add a new URL Type.
Enter a unique identifier (reverse DNS format is a common convention, like com.yourcompany.gxc) and your URL Scheme (gxc).
